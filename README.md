## Quick Start with GitHub Copilot

[![Use The Template](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&label=Use+The+Template&message=GitHub&color=181717&logo=github)](https://github.com/azure-ai-foundry/foundry-models-playground/generate)

> [This GitHub template](https://github.com/azure-ai-foundry/foundry-mcp-playground) has minimal setup with MCP server configuration and all required dependencies, making it easy to get started with your own projects.

[![Install in VS Code](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&label=Install+in+VS+Code&message=Open&color=007ACC&logo=visualstudiocode)](https://insiders.vscode.dev/redirect/mcp/install?name=Azure%20AI%20Foundry%20MCP%20Server&config=%7B%22type%22%3A%22stdio%22%2C%22command%22%3A%22uvx%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22--prerelease%3Dallow%22%2C%22--from%22%2C%22git%2Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fazure-ai-foundry%2Fmcp-foundry.git%22%2C%22run-azure-ai-foundry-mcp%22%5D%7D)

> This helps you automatically set up the MCP server in your VS Code environment under user settings.
> You will need `uvx` installed in your environment to run the server.

## Manual Setup

1. Install `uv` by following [Installing uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).
1. Start a new workspace in VS Code.
1. (Optional) Create `.env` file in the root of your workspace to set environment variables.
1. Create `.vscode/mcp.json` in the root of your workspace.

    ```json
    {
        "servers": {
            "mcp_foundry_server": {
                "type": "stdio",
                "command": "uvx",
                "args": [
                    "--prerelease=allow",
                    "--from",
                    "git+https://github.com/azure-ai-foundry/mcp-foundry.git",
                    "run-azure-ai-foundry-mcp",
                    "--envFile",
                    "${workspaceFolder}/.env"
                ]
            }
        }
    }
    ```

1. Click `Start` button for the server in `.vscode/mcp.json` file.
1. Open GitHub Copilot chat in Agent mode and start asking questions.

See [More examples for advanced setup](./clients/README.md) for more details on how to set up the MCP server.

## Setting the Environment Variables

To securely pass information to the MCP server, such as API keys, endpoints, and other sensitive data, you can use environment variables. This is especially important for tools that require authentication or access to external services.

You can set these environment variables in a `.env` file in the root of your project. You can pass the location of `.env` file when setting up MCP Server, and the server will automatically load these variables when it starts.

See [example .env file](./clients/python/pydantic-ai/.env.example) for a sample configuration.

> [!NOTE]
> **Model**
> - `GITHUB_TOKEN` is used to authenticate with GitHub API for testing models. It is not required if you are exploring models from Foundry catalog.
>
> **Knowledge**
> - See [Create a search service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/search-create-service-portal) to learn more about provisioning a search service.
> - Azure AI Search supports multiple authentication methods. You can use either a **Microsoft Entra authentication** or an **Key-based authentication** to authenticate your requests. The choice of authentication method depends on your security requirements and the Azure environment you are working in.
> - See [Authenication](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/search-security-overview#authentication) to learn more about authentication methods for a search service.
>
> **Evaluation**
> - If you're using **agent tools or safety evaluators**, make sure the Azure project credentials are valid.
> - If you're only doing **text quality evaluation**, the OpenAI endpoint and key are sufficient.
